# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to compare financial parameters of ride-sharing data amongst different types of cities (rural, urban, suburban). First, we will create a summary table that includes data for the amount of rides, drivers, and ride fares amongst these different city types. We will use this information to collect the average fare per ride and per driver. Next, we will create a graph that shows the trends of weekly and monthly ride fare spending to analyze which months of the year yield increased ride fare spending.

## Results

### PyBer Summary Data

The PyBer ride-sharing data summary shows lots of interesting data to consider. First, urban cities generate the most rides (1,625), drivers (2,405), and fare revenue ($39,854.38); while rural cities produce the least in all three categories (see step 8, deliverable 1). However, the average fare per ride and per driver is the highest for rural cities; at $34.62, and $55.49, respectively. Suburban cities fall in between rural and urban cities in all of these categories.

### PyBer Trends

Next, we created a graph to analyze weekly and monthly trends of the total amount of fares by city type. First, we see some similiarties in trends such as an increase in total fares from mid-Feburary to the beginning of March. However, there are some differences in the trends. For example, between March and April, urban cities show a pattern of rapid increases and decreases in total fares which is in contrast to suburban and rural cities that show a steady increase (C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\Data Analytics Boot Camp\PyBer\PyBer_Analysis\Analysis\PyBer_fare_summary.png).

## Summary

My main recommendation for PyBer is provide more incentive to rural and suburban habitants to use ride-sharing with other individuals. If many individuals are going to the same place, provide them with the opportunity to share the ride with someone else and let them know that they will recieve a discount to do so. I believe that this will help reduce financial hesitancy regarding using PyBer.
